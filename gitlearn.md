Hopefully I am doing these changes under thenewmona@gmail.com account.  
This is a test to see if I have this setup right and figured out.  

Okay logged into GIT under codinggrandma, I can see the changes that I made, but when I go to make a pull request it states that there is nothing to compare. 

Not sure what it is that I am doing wrong. 

Looked at both accounts, so I don't have something configured right

**10/4/2019** Links

Today I am learning how to add an image to a readme file in github.
I am also working on linking in Github.
Here is a link to some [Resources](gitresources.md) that I used to help me with this. 
Give it a try, when your done don't forget to do a PR.

**10/7/2019** Adding images 

Having issues with my repo on Github, so I am a little late with getting the image. 
I did put an image on the git-journey page.
It works fine, but when I try this way as per the video, I an not get it to render.
