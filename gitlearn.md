## Gitlearn 

**[thenewmona](https://github.com/thenewmona)**  
Hopefully I am doing these changes under thenewmona@gmail.com account.  
This is a test to see if I have this setup right and figured out.  

Okay logged into GIT under codinggrandma, I can see the changes that I made, but when I go to make a pull request it states that there is nothing to compare. 

Not sure what it is that I am doing wrong. 

Looked at both accounts, so I don't have something configured right
