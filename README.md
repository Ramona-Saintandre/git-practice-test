# git-practice-test

 This is a repository to play with GIT functionality 

 I will be working with various GIT extensions, Github desktop, and command lines tools. 

 Will also be working with the Github interface on the web. 

 Figuring out how to label, update, merge etc. 

 Feel free to create what ever you would like in this. 

 Please document what you did or are trying to do in the gitlearn.md documentation.
