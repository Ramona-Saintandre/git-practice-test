Unfortunately I missed the mark this weekend.
Did not work on any of my goals that I set, 
Following some recommendations from Stackoverflow, in regards to have .git file inside of the folders of the master, could be a reason why my folders are grayed out. 

Tried to remove the .git file animation nation.
I then created a branch ,created my folder, inside the folder I created my HTML boiler plate. 
I then did a commit with a pull request. 
Went into Github, and verified the PR, and then merged the PR. 
But the folder is still grayed out in Github.

I really need to get better at keeping up with my journaling. 
not sure why there is nothing here since the 7th.
I have two pull requests that I need to figure out how to merge. 
So my goal today is to merge, and close these pull request. 
Still have not figured out how to fix the grayed out folders in GIThub. 
Also have orientation today with GC, school is getting real.

Still having issues with  the grayed out folders. 
Deleted the cutter folder, and then recloned it.
But when I go to add it I get this error message. 

 `git add ..
fatal: ..: '..' is outside repository`

So need to figure out how to fix this error message, so I can see if I fixed my folder issue. 

I am just having one issue after another.  
All issues are in the gitlearn.md, but I am thinking that I am going to make an issues.md, because the gitlearn.md was suppose to be challenges and things that I or other's want to learn.
