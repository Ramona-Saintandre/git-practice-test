The beginning of git journey. 
The goal is to become profiecent with GIT and it's functionality. 
Today I am created my first repo and setting it up for colaboration with Hacktoberfest.   
 ##Goals fo today
 * [ ] learn to create labels 
 * [ ] get the configuration correct for working with multiple git accounts 
 * [ ] learn how to merge a pull request 
 * [ ] should I put this in the README.md so everyone can see 
 * [ ] learn one new GIT command today 

 ##ISSUES  
Need to figure out why even though I am logged in as codinggrandma using the codinggrandma credentials. 
I can not do a push to the repo from VScode, only from the Gitdesktop
